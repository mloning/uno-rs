# Rust implementation of Uno card game

For my Python implementation, see this [blog post](https://www.mloning.com/posts/implementing-uno-card-game-in-python) and [repo](https://github.com/mloning/uno-py).

For Uno rules, see [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)) or these [instructions](<https://service.mattel.com/instruction_sheets/UNO%20Power%20Grab%20Rules.pdf>).

## How to play

Run: `cargo run`

## Development

* `cargo run` 
* `cargo clippy` for linting using [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)
* `cargo test --lib` run unit tests in library 
* `cargo add <dependency>` to add a new dependency
